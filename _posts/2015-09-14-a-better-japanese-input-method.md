title: Mozc-Ut -- A Better Japanese Input Method On Linux
---
As we know mozc is an opensource Japanese input method which is the base of Google Japanese Input Method. [Mozc-ut](http://www.geocities.jp/ep3797/mozc_01.html) adds some useful dictionaries such as:

*  alt-cannadic
*  Japanese names (I wrote it)
*  hatena keywords
*  SKK-JISYO.L
*  EDICT
*  station names

Mozc-ut also provides a nico dictionary which is from nicodaihyakka. But this nico dict it provides is not up-to-date, so you'd better download from [upstream](http://tkido.com/blog/1019.html) and import it by yourself.

If you're an archlinux user, you can install mozc-ut from [aur](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/fcitx-mozc-ut/).

If you're an opensuse user, you can add my [repo](http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/amazingfate/).

If you're a debian user, you can add [my debian repo](http://amazingfate.github.io/posts/my-debian-repo/).
